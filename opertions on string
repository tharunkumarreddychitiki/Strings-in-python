''' operations on strings in python.
    I don't know that there are this many operations that can be done on stringsitself.
    there are so many operations like string slicing, upper() method, lower() method, etc.
    Today I am going to try someof these methods.'''
# for example let us take a string as an input.
text = input("Enter the text : ")
# String indexing. The string is a collection unicode characters in a form of array.
# We can access the part of the string using thestart and end index.
#  For example
print(f"Example for 'String Slicing':\n {text[5:]}")
# Here I can slice the string from anywhere just by taking the start and end index. This is called "String slicing"

# upper() Statement : The upper() method is used to convert the lower case letters into upper case letters.
print(f"Example for 'upper() method':\n {text.upper()}")

# lower() Statement : The lower() method statement is just opposite to the upper() statement.
print(f"Example for 'lower() method':\n{text.lower()}")

# swapcase() Statement : the swapcase() method converts the characters into opposite case. 
print(f"Example for 'swapcase() method':\n{text.swapcase()}")
# rstrip() Statement : The rstrip() method reoves any trailing characters in a String.
print(f"Example for 'rstrip() method':\n{text.rstrip("!")}")

# replace() Statement : The replace() method is used to replace a string with a given value.
print(f"Example for 'replace() method':\n{text.replace("kumar","Reddy")}")

# capitalize() Statement : This method converts the first character into uppercase and the remaining into the lowercase letters.
print(f"Example for 'capitalize() method':\n{text.capitalize()}")

# title () statement : This method converts first character of the every word in the string.
print(f"Example for 'title() method':\n{text.title()}")

# count() Statement : This method returns the number of times the given value has occured in  the string. 
print(f"Example for 'count() method':\n{text.count("a")}")
''' There are still many methods that can be performed on strings. 
    For example endswith(), startswith(), islower(), isupper(), isalnum(), isalpha(), istitle(), isprintable(), isspace(),etc. 
    These methods checks wether the conditon matches and returns the boolean value as the result.'''
